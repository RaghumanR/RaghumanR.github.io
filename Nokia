 <p>About Lumia</p><br>
 <p class="p1">Microsoft Lumia (previously the Nokia Lumia Series) is a range of mobile devices designed and marketed by Microsoft
 Mobile and previously by Nokia. Introduced in November 2011, the line was the result of a long-term partnership between 
 Nokia and Microsoft as such, all Lumia smartphones run the Windows Phone operating system. The Lumia name is derived from 
 the partitive plural form of the Finnish word lumi, meaning "snow".
 <br><br>
 On 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its purchase
 of Nokia's mobile device business, with the deal closing on 25 April 2014. As a result, the Lumia line is now maintained 
 by Microsoft Mobile. As part of the transition, Microsoft continued to use the Nokia brand on Lumia devices until October
 2014, when it began to officially phase out the Nokia name in its promotion and production of smartphones in favor of 
 Microsoft branding.[3] In November 2014, Microsoft announced the first Microsoft (non-Nokia) branded Lumia device, the 
 Lumia 535.[4] In October 2015, Microsoft announced the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile, the Lumia 950, 
 Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550.

Nokia and Microsoft Mobile have released several updates unique to Lumia devices, the releases contain a combination 
of firmware and software updates which include imaging improvements, new technology support, as well as feature updates
 and bug fixes. Because Lumia devices exclusively use Windows Phone, major operating system updates are often bundled 
 with the firmware updates upon release.<br><br>
